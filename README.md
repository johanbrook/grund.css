# Grund – a foundation to build upon

"Grund" is "foundation" in Swedish. This is my own SCSS foundation I start out new projects from. It's built with [Compass](http://compass-style.org) in mind, but that dependency can be easily pulled out.

## Why create Grund?

Since I'm tired of setting up the same file structure for every new project. I find myself copying over the same files and snippets all over again. Having these resources in a repository is great for collaboration, learning and developing good practices.

Building modular reusable CSS is hard. Thanks to [SCSS](http://sass-lang.org) we are able to do some more fancy work, but when developing a semi-large project it's important to have structure and a way of thinking. 

I've written a post on the subject some time ago which you should read: ["Bringing order to CSS"](http://johanbrook.com/design/css/bringing-order-to-css/). 

## Installation

There are a couple of ways:

### 1. Use the gem

I've created a [RubyGem](http://rubygems.org) for easy installations of Grund. You didn't think I'd create a reusable CSS foundation without a quick way of putting it into a new project, did you?

	gem install grund
	grund install

It'll pull down the files in this repo and put it in the current directory. Run `grund help` for brief info. The repository for the CLI client is located here: [github.com/johanbrook/grund](https://github.com/johanbrook/grund).

### 2. Download the ZIP package

Download the **[ZIP file](https://github.com/johanbrook/grund.css/zipball/master)** with the files.

### 3. Clone the git repo

	git clone git://github.com/johanbrook/grund.css.git

For development, forking, etc.

## How I use the file structure

The [sass-globbing](https://github.com/chriseppstein/sass-globbing) gem lets you include whole trees of Scss files. Se `_main.scss`. Thus, all files in the directories `common`, `partials`, and `views` will be auto imported in `_main.scss`.

Install `sass-globbing` with

	gem install sass-globbing

- `common`. I usually put common stuff in .. yeah, `common`. It may be general, site wide things like styles for buttons, forms, headings, modal boxes, etc. 
- `lib`. In here, styles which potentially can be re-used in different projects should live. General helpers, mixins, font definitions, animations, etc.
- `partials`. Here I put styles for different regions of the site, such as header, footer, articles, etc.
- `views` contains a Scss file for each major view of the site. Could be structured in nested directories, thanks to `sass-globbing`.
- `viewports` contains files with media queries. Must be explicitly imported in `_main.scss`.

## Contribute

Contributions, tips and suggestions are welcomed! CSS is a living thing – new best practices develops, and while I'd like to keep the bloat down, it would be great to learn how others are doing it.
